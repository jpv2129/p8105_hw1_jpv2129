## Problem 1

Loading the dataset

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather") #loads the dataset
```

Getting the number of rows/columns in the dataset and mean temp from the
dataset.

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather) #gets rows
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather) #gets columns
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
mean(with(early_january_weather, temp)) #calculating the mean temp
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

Dataset description: There are 15 variables in the dataset.

The names of the variables are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
and time_hour.

The important variables seem to be temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, and visib as these are the
variables listed that mainly contribute to weather patterns.

There are 15 columns in the dataset and 358 rows (or observations).

The mean temp from the dataset is 39.58212 F.

Scatterplot:

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour,y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point() #making the scatterplot with color points for humidity
```

![](p8105_hw1_jpv2129_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("temp_vs_time_scatterplot.png") #saving scatterplot into project directory
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Description of patterns in scatterplot: The scatterplot shows
temperature changes over time in January, with color indicating
humidity. Overall, temperatures fluctuate daily but gradually increase
from early to mid-January, starting mostly between 25–40°F through Jan
7th and more frequently rising to 45–55°F closer to January 14.

Humidity increases with warmer temperatures and spikes in mid-January
when temperatures peak. Lower humidity values are more evenly spread and
more common at cooler temperatures.

## Problem 2

Creating the dataframe:

``` r
problem2_df = #creating my own dataframe with conditions described.
  tibble(
    randsamp = rnorm(10), # random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
    logic = rnorm(10) > 0, # a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
    char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"), # a character vector of length 10
    fac = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "female", "other", "other", "male", "female")) # a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
  )

#taking means below
mean(problem2_df |>  pull(randsamp))    # works
```

    ## [1] -0.08960245

``` r
mean(problem2_df |>  pull(logic))   # works
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(problem2_df |>  pull(char))   # error 
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem2_df |>  pull(fac))    # error 
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Here, we see that only the means for our random sample and logic vector
work, while the means for the character and factor do not work. This is
because the latter are not numerical or logic value and are character
values. Logic works because TRUE converts to 1 and FALSE converts to 0.

Now, convert variables to numeric values.

``` r
# Convert to numeric by pulling from the tibble
logicnum <- as.numeric(problem2_df |> pull(logic))    # logical -> numeric (TRUE=1, FALSE=0)
charnum  <- as.numeric(problem2_df |> pull(char))  # character -> numeric, produces NA + warning
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
facnum   <- as.numeric(problem2_df |> pull(fac))    # factor -> numeric (uses internal integer codes)

mean(logicnum) #works
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(charnum) #error
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(facnum)   #works
```

    ## [1] 1.8
